      <h2 class="text-center" id="searl">Searle's Engine</h2>
      <p>
        The Searl Effect was discovered by John Roy Robert Searl in 1946.
Put simply, it is a method of extracting clean and sustainable electrical energy.
The SEG consists of three fixed stator rings that are uniquely magnetized with patterns setup to generate continual motion of similarly magnetized cylindrical rotors. The magnetic rotors or rollers consist of eight segmented components made of the same four layers of concentric materials that make up the stators. The rollers have both freedom of spin and rotation around the stator which generates both mechanical and electrical power.
The SEG is an 'open system' of energy conversion that is in accordance with known thermodynamic laws; particularly as it may apply at the quantum level. The open energy cycle of the SEG enables it to function both as a prime mover of mechanical rotors, but more so as an electrical generator that continuously interacts and processes energy from the natural environment.
Incidental effects includes a halo of negative air ionization or plasma, vacuum by extreme electrical charge, cooling temperatures of both device and the local environment; also gravitational and inertial anomalies under specific conditions.
The Searl Effect is based on magnetic waveforms that generates a continual motion of magnetized rollers around magnetized rings.
Energy conversion while operating involves processing of random quantum fluctuations and kinetic energy within the atomic lattice into coherent currents of electron pairs formed between two-dimensional boundaries of different type materials. Therein between surface boundaries, the Quantum Hall Effect of a strong pulsing magnetic field are electron transformations (compression) that dramatically decreases the device temperature with increasing mean free paths (conductivity) due to the increase in fermion pair formations or bosons tunneling through all of the concentric material layers of the Searl Effect Generator. Thereafter, the external sources of electrons are attracted back to the relatively positive potential of the electron depleted neodymium layer (reservoir) where the energy cycle continuously repeats. It is a process that effectively strips kinetic energy out the of electrons before they are emitted; no different in principle from the energy cycle of the hydroelectric dam where the kinetics of the water flow are harnessed. In this manner, both ways gather ambient sources of energy that can be processed and made useful for electrical applications.

      <h2 class="text-center" id="anti">Antikythera Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        The Antikythera mechanism (/ˌæntɪkɪˈθɪərə/, /ˌæntɪˈkɪθərə/) is an ancient hand powered Greek analogue computer which has also been described as the first example of such device used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendar and astrological purposes decades in advance. It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.

This artefact was retrieved from the sea in 1901, and identified on 17 May 1902 as containing a gear by archaeologist Valerios Stais, among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera. The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists and has been variously dated to about 87 BC, or between 150 and 100 BC, or to 205 BC, or to within a generation before the shipwreck, which has been dated to approximately 70–60 BC.[25][26]

The device, housed in the remains of a 34 cm × 18 cm × 9 cm (13.4 in × 7.1 in × 3.5 in) wooden box, was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation efforts. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others. The largest gear is approximately 14 centimetres (5.5 in) in diameter and originally had 223 teeth.

It is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears. A team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at Cardiff University used modern computer x-ray tomography and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine.

      <h2 class="text-center" id="zhang">Zhang Heng’s Seismoscope</h2>
      <p>
        In 132 CE, inventor, Imperial Historian, and Royal Astronomer Zhang Heng displayed his amazing earthquake-detection machine, or seismoscope, at the court of the Han Dynasty. Zhang's seismoscope was a giant bronze vessel, resembling a barrel almost 6 feet in diameter. Eight dragons snaked face-down along the outside of the barrel, marking the primary compass directions. In each dragon's mouth was a small bronze ball. Beneath the dragons sat eight bronze toads, with their broad mouths gaping to receive the balls.The exact mechanism that caused a ball to drop in the event of an earthquake also is not known. One theory is that a thin stick was set loosely down the center of the barrel. An earthquake would cause the stick to topple over in the direction of the seismic shock, triggering one of the dragons to open its mouth and release the bronze ball.

Another theory posits that a baton was suspended from the lid of the instrument as a free-swinging pendulum. When the pendulum swung widely enough to strike the side of the barrel, it would cause the closest dragon to release its ball. The sound of the ball striking the toad's mouth would alert observers to the earthquake. This would give a rough indication of the earthquake's direction of origin, but it did not provide any information about the intensity of the tremors.Zhang's wonderful machine was called houfeng didong yi, meaning "an instrument for measuring the winds and the movements of the Earth." In earthquake-prone China, this was an important invention. 

In one instance, just six years after the device was invented, a large quake estimated at a magnitude seven struck what is now Gansu Province. People in the Han Dynasty's capital city of Luoyang, 1,000 miles away, did not feel the shock. However, the seismoscope alerted the emperor's government to the fact that a quake had struck somewhere to the west. This is the first known instance of scientific equipment detecting an earthquake that had not been felt by humans in the area. The seismoscope's findings were confirmed several days later when messengers arrived in Luoyang to report a major earthquake in Gansu.
