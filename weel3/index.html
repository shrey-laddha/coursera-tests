      <p>
        Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. 
        It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and 
        the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa.
        The name Asia is ancient, and its origin has been variously explained. 
        The Greeks used it to designate the lands situated to the east of their homeland. 
        It is believed that the name may be derived from the Assyrian word asu, meaning “east.” 
        Another possible explanation is that it was originally a local name given to the plains of Ephesus, 
        which ancient Greeks and Romans extended to refer first to Anatolia (contemporary Asia Minor, 
        which is the western extreme of mainland Asia), and then to the known world east of the Mediterranean Sea. 
        When Western explorers reached South and East Asia in early modern times, they extended that label to the whole 
        of the immense landmass.
        Asia is bounded by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the east, 
        the Indian Ocean to the south, the Red Sea (as well as the inland seas of the Atlantic 
        Ocean—the Mediterranean and the Black) to the southwest, and Europe to the west. Asia is 
        separated from North America to the northeast by the Bering Strait and from Australia to the southeast 
        by the seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans. The Isthmus of Suez unites Asia with Africa, 
        and it is generally agreed that the Suez Canal forms the border between them. Two narrow straits, the Bosporus 
        and the Dardanelles, separate Anatolia from the Balkan Peninsula.

      <h2 class="text-center" id="africa">Africa</h2>
      <p>
        Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia. 
        At about 30.3 million km² including adjacent islands, 
        it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area. With 1.3 billion people as of 2018, 
        it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population.
        Africa’s total land area is approximately 11,724,000 square miles (30,365,000 square km), 
        and the continent measures about 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from north to south and 
        about 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from east to west. Its northern extremity is Al-Ghīrān Point, 
        near Al-Abyaḍ Point (Cape Blanc), Tunisia; its southern extremity is Cape Agulhas, South Africa; 
        its farthest point east is Xaafuun (Hafun) Point, near Cape Gwardafuy (Guardafui), Somalia; 
        and its western extremity is Almadi Point (Pointe des Almadies), on Cape Verde (Cap Vert), Senegal. 
        In the northeast, Africa was joined to Asia by the Sinai Peninsula until the construction of the Suez Canal. 
        Paradoxically, the coastline of Africa—18,950 miles (30,500 km) in length—is shorter than that of Europe, 
        because there are few inlets and few large bays or gulfs.

      <h2 class="text-center" id="europe">Europe</h2>
      <p>
        Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. 
        It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, 
        the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east.
        Europe, second smallest of the world’s continents, 
        composed of the westward-projecting peninsulas of Eurasia (the great landmass that it shares with Asia) 
        and occupying nearly one-fifteenth of the world’s total land area. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic Ocean, 
        on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south (west to east) by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, 
        the Kuma-Manych Depression, and the Caspian Sea. The continent’s eastern boundary (north to south) 
        runs along the Ural Mountains and then roughly southwest along the Emba (Zhem) River, 
        terminating at the northern Caspian coast.
